Assessing the likelihood that Brian Boquist created an Ashley 
Madison Account 

In this note, we examine an account found in the 2015 
Ashley Madison data dump and determine that there is high probability 
that the account was created by Brian Boquist.  The Oregon State Senator
 has made news recently by making threats to fellow members of Oregon 
Senate, saying that ``hell would visit them personally.<font face="symbol">¢</font><font face="symbol">¢</font>
  He has since made several public statements justifying this language 
by refering to Catholic faith, including statements in a lawsuit which 
attest to faith, consequences of sin, and the duty to call out the 
sinner.  
Even with generous assumptions, we estimate that the probability that 
someone other than Sen. Boquist created the account is less than 1\%.  

\endabstract

<p><a name="toc.1"></a></p><h1><a name="toc.1">1&nbsp;Background</a></h1><a name="toc.1">
In June 2019, the Democratic Majority in the Oregon Senate attempted to 
pass a cap-and-trade bill.  Oregon Senate requires a quorum, so Senate 
Republicans declared their intention to leave the capitol and prevent 
the legislative session from moving forward.  Oregon Governor Kate Brown
 indicated that she would be using the powers granted by the Oregon 
Constitution to ``compel<font face="symbol">¢</font><font face="symbol">¢</font>
 the senators to return: up to and including sending Oregon State Police
 after the senators.  Sen. Boquist, a military veteran who is known to 
carry guns, responded with the statement ``send bachelors, and come 
heavily armed.<font face="symbol">¢</font><font face="symbol">¢</font>  
He also told Senate President Peter Courtney that ``If you send the 
state police to get me, hell is coming to visit you personally.<font face="symbol">¢</font><font face="symbol">¢</font>
The Republican senators fled to Idaho and did not return until the 
cap-and-trade bill was dropped from the agenda.  Upon returing, an 
assessment was made that the threats made by Sen. Boquist should be 
taken seriously. A senate committee decided to require that Boquist give
 12 hour notice before visting Salem.  

Boquist then made statements justifying his language : ``send 
bachelors...<font face="symbol">¢</font><font face="symbol">¢</font> is 
 simply an old military expression.  The statement to President 
Courtney, however, came from their shared Catholic faith.  Boquist made 
several references to his faith in memos and in a lawsuit filed against 
Courtney and others </a><a href="#bib.0">[0]</a>.

In 2015, hackers orchestrated a well-publicized data dump of the Ashley 
Madison website. Ashley Madison did not require users to use their 
names, but did keep track of credit card data.   At the time, many of 
the users were <font face="symbol">¢</font>doxxed<font face="symbol">¢</font> because their names were on credit card transactions, others were <font face="symbol">¢</font>doxxed<font face="symbol">¢</font>
 because they had short-sightedly used their identifiable work email 
address when setting up the account.   However, a large portion of the 
user accounts remained unlinked.

Despite the fact that accounts may not contain names, or identifiable 
email addresses, some accounts can be linked with high probability to 
individuals: The date-of-birth, zipcode, height, wieght, and security 
question and answer in some cases can specify the individual uniquely 
with reasonable probability.   

An account exists in the Ashley Madison database that matches Sen 
Boquist<font face="symbol">¢</font>s zipcode, date of birth, place of 
work, (by our estimation) approximate height and wieght, and most 
significantly, his high school.  
We will argue first that there is little probability that this account 
was created by someone else.  Next, we will argue that this is an issue 
that should be brought to the attention of, at the very least the court 
hearing the case <a href="#bib.0">[0]</a>, and perhaps even the general public. 

<p><a name="toc.2"></a></p><h1><a name="toc.2">2&nbsp;The account</a></h1><a name="toc.2">

We grepped the file \beginverbatim ``am_am.dump<font face="symbol">¢</font><font face="symbol">¢</font>
 \endverbatim  using python.  This file is the dump of an SQL database. 
 Reading the file as a string, the headers are given in positions 
[1003:3140].   The account in question occurs in position 
[2774910130:2774910456] and is the following string :

\endverbatim

With this in hand, we grepped the file \beginverbatim 
"aminno_member_email.dump" \endverbatim and 
\beginverbatim"aminno_member.dump" \endverbatim and determined that the 
email address ``TrueOregon@aol.com<font face="symbol">¢</font><font face="symbol">¢</font> was associated to account 8152436 as well as the ip address <font face="symbol">¢</font>206.212.234.92<font face="symbol">¢</font> and the username	<font face="symbol">¢</font>paradise06<font face="symbol">¢</font>.

The zipcode 97338 is given as Boquists on numerous documents going back well before 2011, and including the complaint </a><a href="#bib.0">[0]</a>.

It is crucial to note that the final two fields in the first table are 
security question and answer: Security question # 2 corresponds to name 
of high school.  (This can be confirmed by inspecting other answers as 
well as other sources on the internet.)  The fields containing ``79380<font face="symbol">¢</font><font face="symbol">¢</font> and ``178<font face="symbol">¢</font><font face="symbol">¢</font> are wieght and height in metric units. 



<p><a name="toc.3"></a></p><h1><a name="toc.3">3&nbsp;Analysis of the account</a></h1><a name="toc.3">
We begin with some extremely rough ways to estimate the probability that
 this account was created by someone other than Sen. Boquist as a warmup
 and then attempt to build a more thorough model. 
We will assume that the data given is not falsified. While certainly 
some accounts were created with falsified information, the motivation 
for intentionally matching Boquist<font face="symbol">¢</font>s data is 
unclear.  It is also remotely possible that someone chose the data at 
random: Perhaps the security question was correct, but the birthday or 
zipcode was chosen and random.  We<font face="symbol">¢</font>re going to ignore these possibilities. 

</a><p><a name="toc.3"></a><a name="toc.3.1"></a></p><h2><a name="toc.3.1">3.1&nbsp;First rough estimation: birthdate and current zipcode</a></h2><a name="toc.3.1">
Quickly searching cf. </a><a href="#bib.1">[1]</a> we find that as of 2010, there were 20045 people in the zipcode, of which approximately 9722 are male.  More searching cf. <a href="#bib.2">[2]</a>
 turns up 2016 data that  12.2 \% of males are age 45-55 and 11.3 in the
 next age group 55-65.   We will use this number to guess that there are
 approximately 12 percent of the 9722 males are born in this decade, 
that is, about 1167 males born in this decade.  Dividing this by 10 
years in the decade, for simplicity, we would guess that about 117 male 
residents of zipcode 97338 were born in 1958.  
Treating this as a Poisson distribution with <font face="symbol">l</font> = 117/365 we conclude there is a 72.5\% chance that nobody else matches this birthday/zipcode criteria.

<p><a name="toc.3.2"></a></p><h2><a name="toc.3.2">3.2&nbsp;Second rough estimation: birthdate and Tillamook High School</a></h2><a name="toc.3.2">

Recent data says the enrollment and Tillamook high school is around 600.
  We can find data from the 1990s in Oregon Dropout Rate Reports with 
Enrollment as high as 784.   We will be generous, and allow for 800, or 
approximately 200 per class, and assume the four year dropout rate was 
about 20\%.  See </a><a href="#bib.3">[3]</a>.  So 160 is a generous 
upper bound on the number of graduates per year.  Dividing by 2, for 
males, we get about 80 males per year.  
Treating this as a Poisson distribution with <font face="symbol">l</font> = 80/365 We conclude there is a 80\% chance that nobody else matches this birthday/high school criteria.


<p><a name="toc.3.3"></a></p><h2><a name="toc.3.3">3.3&nbsp;Combining birthday with geographic mobility</a></h2><a name="toc.3.3">

Already the data suggests there is reasonable likelihood the account 
belongs to him.  However, the most significant piece is the combination -
 we need to estimate the probability that someone who went to high 
school in Tillamook ends up in zipcode 97338.  
To describe our model, we will use the number 80 above as the number of 
males in the 1977 graduating class, and consider an individual in this 
roughly 80.  We want to combine the independent probability that this 
individual had both Boquist<font face="symbol">¢</font>s birthday, and resides in Boquist<font face="symbol">¢</font>s
 zipcode 35 years later.  

Tillamook is not immediately close to Dallas, they are separated by 
about an hour twenty minutes drive and over 60 miles.  Note that this is
 roughly the same distance from Tillamook to Hillsboro, which is a 
well-populated western suburb of Portand. So the geographic radius 
centered at Tillamook that includes Dallas would also include 
significant Portland metropolitan population.  (The total Portland 
metropolitan population is estimated at 2.7 million.)  However this 
might not be fair; Portland is culturally different from surrounding 
rural Oregon areas, so one may expect more mobility between places like 
Tillamook and Dallas than between Tillamook and Portland.  So we will be
 generous and exclude the entire Portland area.  (In fact this is even 
more generous, in 35 years, certainly many Tillamook high graduates have
 left the state altogether.)   Tillamook is surrounded by a ring of 
counties with similar demographics.  Polk County, which holds Dallas,  
is one of the two <font face="symbol">¢</font>kitty-corner<font face="symbol">¢</font> counties in the ring that doesn<font face="symbol">¢</font>t
 share a border with Tillamook County. One of these counties in 
Washington County, which is the largest populated because it contains 
Hillsboro. We will exclude this county.  To be rough, we add the 
population in this ring of counties, including Tillamook, excluding 
Washington, and assume, ham-handedly that the Tillamook high school 
population is dispersed randomly over this ring of counties.    That is,
 we take Clatsop, Columbia, exclude Washington, Yamhill Polk and 
Lincoln. Quick wikipedia use (which uses 2010 census data) gives about 
330,000 people in this area.  Considering that only 20,000 are in 97338,
 we have only about 6\% probability that a given individual would land 
in 97338 zipcode.  So the probability that someone who graduated 
Tillamook High School in 1977 and then lived in 97338 and also had an 
October 20th birthday is roughly 0.0166\%.

Next we ratchet this number down smaller, by considering weight given. 
We will again be very generous here, and assume only that the account 
creator is not obese.  (The metric conversion gives the account creator a
 healthy weight of 175 lbs.)   Using the statistic that 34\% of 
Oregonian in the age group 45-64 are obese, we say that this would rule 
out a third of potential candidates.  In fact the given weight is well 
below the median, but we will give them room to fudge their profile 
stats. (It<font face="symbol">¢</font>s also unclear, without more work 
how much the obesity depends on other factors.) So we multiply the 
percentage  0.0166 by 0.67 and get about a 0.011\% probability of a 
match.  At this low number, the Poisson distribution scales nearly 
linearly over 80 samples, so we can say, quite generously, that there is
 a 0.9 \% chance that one of Boquist<font face="symbol">¢</font>s male classmates shares his zipcode birthdate, and is also not obese.  
If we assume that the only other option is that Boquist created the account, this gives us over 99\% confidence.

According the Google Maps, the given geocoordinates are smack dab in the
 middle of nowhere, a few yards off perhaps a logging road in Polk

 aimed and Courtney and others, Boquist claims that he is being punished
 for using the phrase ``hell is coming to visit you personally.<font face="symbol">¢</font><font face="symbol">¢</font>

The lawsuit includes 
\beginquote
 4.Plaintiff alleges the Defendants are blocking the Plaintiffs practice
 and expression of religious beliefs stated on the Floor of the Oregon 
State on July 19, 2019 that are protected under the First Amendment of 
the United States Constitution. [sic]
\endquote
Boquist<font face="symbol">¢</font>s statement was not a threat, he 
argues,  but a theological statement of faith.  
The complaint also discusses the fact that Peter Courtney and Boquist 
attend the same Catholic church:

\beginquote
25. Prior to August 2018, to build and maintain civil relations, the 
Plaintiff and Defendant Senate President Peter Courtney met routinely at
 Ike<font face="symbol">¢</font>s Coffee Shop near the Oregon State 
Capitol, sometimes nearly weakly. [sic] Both have routinely discussed 
their catholic religious faith believing in Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell.
 Those discussions included the fear of Defendant Courtney that a 
certain Deacon, or Priest, will deny him communion, if not excommunicate
 him, damning him to Hell for eternity....The weekly Mass recited 
Penitential Act says we are held accountable for our thoughts and in my 
words, in what I have done and in what I have failed to do....Catholic 
Doctrine also says to call out the sinner...
32.The Plaintiff, a fellow practicing Catholic with Defendant Courtney, 
does in fact believe President Courtney<font face="symbol">¢</font>s soul is completely lost now.
\endquote


It is clear that Boquist<font face="symbol">¢</font>s catholic faith is an essential part of the lawsuit:  The use of the word ``Hell<font face="symbol">¢</font><font face="symbol">¢</font> is by someone who believes in Hell and fears that his colleague<font face="symbol">¢</font>s
 soul may end up there.  

Certainly it is well understood that adultery is sinful in the Catholic 
religion, and punishable by damnation as much as any other sin.  But 
unless Boquist went through a temporary weak patch in his faith for 
which he since confessed, a reasonable person would have trouble 
reconciling an account created for the explicit purposes of adultery and
 a deep belief in the consequences of sin.
